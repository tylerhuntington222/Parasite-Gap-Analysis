## Parks for Parasites

#### A spatially explicit gap analysis of current and future overlap between parasite species distributions and IUCN Protected Areas in the contiguous US.


This repository contains all the R code used in our analyses. Each script is thoroughly commented and should be easy to understand by stepping through line by line. Further documentation of the full analysis pipeline (i.e. sequence in which the scripts must be run to produce final results from raw data) to follow. All raw data is housed in our project Dropbox folder.
